<p>This is a dumpling like food commonly found in slavic countries and consists of meat in dough</p>
<p>Can use different forms of meat however it usually a mix of chicken, turkey and beef</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Ingredients Needed for dough</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>2/3 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp sour cream</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups warm water</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>7 cups plus 6 Tbsp unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Ingredients Needed for <em>meat filling</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb ground turkey</li>
    <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, pressed</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground peper</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
<ol>
    <li>Using the whisk attachment on medium speed, mix together: 2/3 cup buttermilk, 1 Tbsp  of sour cream  2 cups warm water, 2 eggs and 1  1/2 tsp salt until well blended</li>
    <li>Switch to dough hook and add 4 cups flour. Mix on speed 2 until well blended.</li>
    <li>Add 3 more cups of flour (one cup at a time and wait for the dough to become well blended with each cup). Add the rest of the flour 1 Tbsp at a time, until the dough is no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl. Once it is no longer sticking to the bowl, continue to mix 5 minutes. (Total mixing time is about 20 minutes from the time you start adding flour).</li>
    <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Steps to make meat filling</strong></h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a medium skillet. Add onion and saute until golden and soft. Add garlic and saute another minute.</li>
    <li>Mix together pork, turkey, onion & garlic mix, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp ground pepper and 1 tsp hot sauce (optional).</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Steps cont.</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Shape a portion of the dough into a 1 to 2 -inch thick log. Cut off 1 piece at a time (about gum ball sized) and roll into disks to form a 1.5-inch circle with rolling pin. Sprinkle rolling pin and surface with flour if needed.</li>
    <li>Place 1 tsp pelmeni filling in the center</li>
    <li>loose the edges and pinch together</li>
    <li>Pinch the corners to gether to form a diaper shape.</li>
    <li>Place pelmeni onto a well-floured cutting board. Arrange pelmeni evenly on the cutting board, sprinkle with flour and place in the freezer.</li>
    <li>Once they are fully frozen, put them in large ziploc bags, sprinkle with flour and freeze them for future enjoyment.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong><em>Cooking Instructions</em></strong></h2>
<p>Bring a pot of water to boil (add 1 Tbsp salt for a large soup pot, or 1 tsp salt for a smaller 4 quart pot). Add FROZEN pelmeni and return to a boil. They should float to the top, then boil for 3 minutes longer (or until meat is fully cooked). Drain pelmeni and place them in a clean bowl. Toss pelmeni with butter and sprinkle with dill (optional). Serve them warm with ketchup, sour cream or vinegar (my personal favorite).</p>
